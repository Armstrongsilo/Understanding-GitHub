# Understanding GitHub
So sooner or later we'll be working with GitHub. This repository was created so we can start working together on simple projects using GitHub. By simply project even a "Hello World" 
addition to an existing code in the repository would mean something.

## Aim

To just get familiar with GitHub before the need arises.

## This is what we will be doing

- **Clone this repository on your local storage using Git.**
> [Click here to download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> [See how to clone a repository here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

- Use your **Git Bash** to perform all actions such as ***cloning this repository, adding and pushing your edited files to this repository, pulling updates from this remote repository, etc.***
> If you don't know how to use Git watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc&t=26s) or  you can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE&t=99s) as well.

- Once you have cloned this project you have a choice of doing any of the following to this project:
  - ***Add your fullname*** and ***track (frontend, backend, and product design)*** to the **name.txt** file already created in this repository.
  - ***Add a code block*** to the **code.js** file in this repository found on the frontend/backend folder. Look at item number five (5) please.
  - If you are a ***product design intern***, you could simply ***create a simple .jpg image that displays your fullname*** 
  and add it to the product design folder created in this repository.
  
- Once any of the above actions have been done, **push your changes to this repository**.

- If you are adding a code block to the **code.js** file, make sure it is ***simple***. The code block should either display your name or do a simple mathematical computation. 
If it is too difficult to do any of those yet just add your name to the ***name.txt*** file already created on this repository.

- Try ***not to delete a persons name or file from the repository. Only clone, edit, push, or add.***




## Code block to add your name to the code.js file
If you don't know how to create an **alert** in JavaScript, use the following code block:

**alert("I am Elliot Yibaebi (Frontend Developer)");**

You can change my name to your name and copy the code. Paste the copied code into the **code.js** file. Remember not to delete other people's code. 
***Once you have done your editing, push the changes to this online repository.***
